Objective
Create a command-line Personal Library Manager that allows users to manage their book collection.
The program should let users add, remove, and search for books. 
Each book will be stored as a dictionary with details like title, author, publication year, genre, and read status. 
The program should also include a menu system, basic statistics, and optional file handling for saving and loading the library.
